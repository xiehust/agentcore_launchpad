# Harness → Runtime Conversion

> One-click conversion of a managed-harness agent into a NEW zip_runtime
> agent so it can run experiments (config-bundle A/B). Introduced 2026-07-13
> (task 07-13-harness-to-runtime). Companion to
> `evaluation-agent-eligibility.md` (why harness is experiment-excluded).

## Scenario: converting a harness agent

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- New API + AgentSpec fields + deployer extension; anything touching
  `app/services/harness_convert.py`, `AgentSpec.code_bundle`, or the
  convert endpoint.

### 2. Signatures

```text
POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/convert            → 202 {"agent", "job_id", "deployment_id"}
```

```python
# app/services/harness_convert.py
export_harness(harness_arn) -> dict[str, str]        # agentcore CLI, scratch project
graft_config_bundle(main_py) -> str                   # raises ConversionError on anchor miss
discover_env(files) -> dict[str, str | None]          # wired value | None (degrades)
flatten_requirements(files, base) -> list[str]        # pyproject deps minus base pins
build_conversion_spec(source, files, base, name) -> AgentSpec
# AgentSpec additions (schemas/agent.py):
code_bundle: dict[str, str] | None      # relpath→content, main.py required, ≤64 files/1MB,
                                        # safe relpaths only, XOR with code
source_harness: dict[str, str] | None   # {agent_id, agent_name, harness_arn}
conversion_notes: dict[str, str] | None # per-capability wiring outcome (UI renders)
# deployer (zip_runtime.py): _generate_code returns bundle main.py;
# write_bundle_files() stages the rest via the on_pkg_ready hook
```

### 3. Contracts

- Conversion is **sync-in-request** for export+graft (~10-15s; the CLI needs
  a project cwd — reusable scratch under `data/harness-export/`), then the
  bundle is **materialized into the spec** and deployed by the untouched
  async zip pipeline. Deploy resume never re-runs the CLI (spec carries all
  files).
- **The graft is mandatory**: exported code bakes `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
  and never reads `get_config_bundle()` — without the graft, experiment
  A/B variants no-op exactly as on the harness. Anchors (CLI 0.21.x):
  the `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """…"""` constant and the
  `system_prompt=DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` construction site. Anchor miss →
  conversion FAILS (no agent row).
- Fidelity v1: prompt (bundle-overridable) + inline tools + memory
  (`MEMORY_MEMORY_*_ID` env wired from `settings.resources.memory_id`).
  **`GATEWAY_*_URL` is never wired**: the exported MCP client no-ops when
  the URL is absent but crashes at import when the URL is set and the M2M
  token fetch fails — wiring it needs verified AgentCore Identity access
  for the NEW runtime's workload identity (future work). Every outcome is
  recorded in `conversion_notes` and rendered in agent detail.
- Naming: `{source}-rt`, then `-2`, `-3`… against non-deleted names.
- pyproject deps are flattened into `spec.requirements` minus base-pin
  package names (base wins; export set verified pure-python/aarch64).

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Error |
|---|---|
| source not found / deleted | 404 `agent.not_found` |
| source not (harness ∧ active) | 400 `agent.convert_unsupported` |
| conversion of same source still deploying | 409 `agent.convert_in_flight` |
| `agentcore` CLI absent | 502 `agent.convert_cli_missing` |
| export/graft failure (anchor miss, CLI error) | 502 `agent.convert_failed`, no row |
| bundle w/o main.py, unsafe path, >64 files/1MB, code+code_bundle | 422 (pydantic) |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- **Good**: convert `aurora-support` → `aurora-support-rt` deploying in ~15s
  request time; notes = prompt wired / tools carried / memory wired /
  kb_gateway not wired; agent experiment-selectable when active.
- **Base**: converting again while the first deploys → 409; after it lands,
  a re-convert yields `-rt-2`.
- **Bad**: CLI codegen drift removes anchors → 502 with "graft anchor
  missing", zero side effects.

### 6. Tests Required

`backend/tests/test_harness_convert.py` (12): graft on the REAL export
fixture (`tests/fixtures/harness_export_main.py`) + anchor-miss failures;
env discovery (memory wired, gateway None, AWS_REGION skipped);
requirements flattening vs base pins; code_bundle validators; bundle file
staging; endpoint guards (400/409/502) + happy path (202, spec shape,
deploy kicked) + name dedupe + clean failure (no leftover rows).

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong
```python
# deploy the export verbatim — experiments would silently no-op
spec.code_bundle = exported_files
# or: wire the gateway URL "for fidelity"
env["GATEWAY_GATEWAY_X_URL"] = url   # M2M failure now crashes at import
```

#### Correct
```python
grafted["main.py"] = graft_config_bundle(files["main.py"])  # A/B-able or fail
env = discover_env(grafted)          # memory wired, gateway stays None + noted
```

> **Warning**: the exported code's model id is baked (whatever the harness
> used); the exec role must be able to invoke it. The scratch export dir
> under `data/harness-export/` is a cache — safe to delete anytime.
