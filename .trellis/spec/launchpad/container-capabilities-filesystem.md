# Claude Agent SDK (container) — Registry Capabilities + Filesystem Config

## Scenario: extending the container method's capabilities or runtime storage

### 1. Scope / Trigger

Cross-layer contract between `frontend/src/pages/CreateAgent.tsx` (container
branch), `backend/app/schemas/agent.py`, `backend/app/deployer/container.py`,
`backend/app/templates/claude_sdk_agent/`, `backend/app/routers/agent_skills.py`
and `backend/app/services/agentcore/runtime.py`. Touch this spec when you add a
capability source, change filesystem/VPC handling, or alter what gets baked into
the container image. Introduced by task `07-12-agent-sdk-capabilities-fs`.

**Load-bearing AWS facts** (verified 2026-07-12, botocore 1.43.44 + devguide
`runtime-filesystem-configurations`):
- `filesystemConfigurations` (Create/UpdateAgentRuntime) is a union list:
  `sessionStorage{mountPath}` | `s3FilesAccessPoint{accessPointArn,mountPath}` |
  `efsAccessPoint{accessPointArn,mountPath}`. Limits: ≤5 total, ≤1 session,
  ≤2 s3, ≤2 efs. Mount path `/mnt/<one-level>` (`/mnt/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+/?`,
  6–200 chars, unique, non-nested).
- BYO (s3/efs) REQUIRES `networkMode: VPC` + `networkModeConfig{subnets,
  securityGroups}` + execution-role mount permissions + TCP 2049 egress.
  Session storage needs none of that.
- Session storage is per-session, survives stop/resume, **reset on every
  runtime version update (= every re-publish)**, 14-day idle expiry.
- System python's botocore (1.42.x) lacks the BYO members — always run backend
  code with `backend/.venv`.

**Live-verified 2026-07-13** (fs-verify-agent + minimal S3 Files env, task
`07-13-fs-policy-getaccesspoint-fix`):
- **The devguide's execution-role policy example is wrong AND incomplete.**
  AgentCore's create/update validation needs THREE statements (see §2/§6):
  `GetAccessPoint` doesn't carry the `s3files:AccessPointArn` condition key and
  authorizes on the **access-point ARN**; validation ALSO demands
  `s3files:ListMountTargets` on the file-system ARN (absent from the docs;
  error surfaces one missing action per attempt).
- **IAM propagation race is real**: Create/UpdateAgentRuntime rejects with
  "Execution role is missing required permissions" when called seconds after
  the provision stage (re)writes the inline policy with a changed AP ARN —
  `_retry_iam_propagation` in the deploy stage retries exactly that rejection
  (observed: 1 retry × 10s sufficed).
- **Access-point root ownership gotcha**: `posixUser` only sets the operation
  identity. The root directory itself must be writable by that uid —
  `rootDirectory.creationPermissions{ownerUid,ownerGid,permissions}` applies
  ONLY if the directory does not already exist at first mount. Putting any
  bucket object under the root prefix beforehand creates it root-owned →
  Permission denied on write. Point APs at a fresh prefix (bucket-side objects
  synced later are fine; they appear root-owned but world-readable).
- Observed runtime behavior: S3 Files mount shows as `127.0.0.1:/` NFSv4.2,
  8.0E capacity; session storage `127.0.0.1:/export` 1.0G — both mounts coexist
  in VPC mode. Bidirectional sync latency ≈30–60s each way (async;
  close-to-open consistency NFS-side, eventual bucket-side).
- S3 Files env prerequisites (setup script pattern in the 07-13 task journal):
  versioned SSE bucket + sync role trusting **`elasticfilesystem.amazonaws.com`**
  (S3 Files reuses the EFS principal) + mount target in a **private** subnet
  (AgentCore VPC ENIs get no public IPs — NAT required for Bedrock egress) in a
  supported AZ (us-west-2: usw2-az1/2/3) + mount-SG ingress 2049 from runtime-SG.

### 2. Signatures

```python
# schemas/agent.py
class FilesystemConfig:   # AgentSpec.filesystem (default: session ON @ /mnt/workspace)
    session_storage: SessionStorageFs | None   # JSON null = disabled
    s3_files: list[ByoMount]  # ≤2, ARN must contain :s3files: …/access-point/
    efs: list[ByoMount]       # ≤2, ARN must match elasticfilesystem access-point
    byo: bool                 # property
AgentSpec.network: VpcNetwork | None  # REQUIRED when filesystem.byo (model_validator)

# deployer/container.py (pure, unit-tested)
_filesystem_configurations(spec) -> list[dict]  # AWS union shapes
_vpc(spec) -> dict | None                       # only when byo AND network set
_fs_policy_document(spec) -> dict | None
#   s3_files → THREE statements (live-verified 2026-07-13):
#     ClientMount+ClientWrite  · Resource=FS-arns · Condition ArnEquals AccessPointArn
#     GetAccessPoint           · Resource=AP-arns · NO condition (key unsupported)
#     ListMountTargets         · Resource=FS-arns (undocumented AgentCore requirement)
#   efs → ClientMount+ClientWrite · Resource "*" + AP condition (unverified live)
_sync_fs_policy(iam, role_arn, agent, spec, log)  # put/delete launchpad-fs-{agent.name}
_retry_iam_propagation(fn, log, attempts=6, delay_s=10, sleeper)  # deploy-stage guard:
#   retries ONLY "missing required permissions" (fresh inline policy not yet visible)
_build_context(spec, agent, log) -> Path        # assemble + bundle spec.skills into .claude/skills/

# deployer/zip_runtime.py
bundle_skill_paths_into(paths, dest_parent, log, *, s3_client=None)  # explicit s3 prefixes

# services/agentcore/runtime.py — create/update_container_runtime new kwargs
filesystem_configurations: list[dict] | None, vpc: dict | None  # vpc→networkMode VPC

# templates/claude_sdk_agent/__init__.py
_mcp_servers(spec)  # env LAUNCHPAD_MCP_SERVERS JSON ∪ spec.tools mcp refs (registry wins)
# ALLOWED_TOOLS = ["Task"] + ["Skill" if spec.skills] + ["mcp__{k}" per merged server]
```

HTTP: `POST /api/agent-skills/import {staging_id, selections:[{index?,name?,
name_override?}]}` → `{skills:[{name, ok, path?, description?, error?,
error_code?}]}`. Consumes the registry's inspect staging
(`/api/registry/skills/inspect`) but uploads to
`s3://{artifacts_bucket}/agent-skills/{uid8}/{name}/` and creates **no registry
record**. Staging drops only when every selection succeeded (frontend batches
its picks in ONE call — per-item calls would drop staging after the first).

### 3. Contracts

- Container capabilities: `spec.tools` mcp refs (`{type:"mcp",name,config.url}`)
  → merged into rendered `MCP_SERVERS` as `{name:{type:"http",url}}`; registry
  entries override same-named free-text JSON keys. Gateway targets are
  harness-only (no auth wiring in the SDK template).
- `spec.skills` (both registry `skills/{name}/` and custom
  `agent-skills/{uid}/{name}/` prefixes) are downloaded at generate-time into
  the build context `.claude/skills/{name}/` — the claude CLI discovers them
  under `/app/.claude` (HOME=/app; the scaffold ships no baked-in subagents
  since 2026-07-13 — the fact-checker sample was dropped as not SDK-native).
  Skill failures log + skip, never sink a deploy.
- Deploy passes `filesystemConfigurations` + `vpc` on BOTH create and update;
  network flips PUBLIC→VPC exactly when BYO mounts exist. Old specs (no
  `filesystem` key) default to session-ON — safe because the version bump resets
  session storage anyway.
- IAM: inline policy `launchpad-fs-{agent.name}` on the shared execution role;
  attached when BYO, deleted when mounts removed or agent deleted (best-effort).
- Frontend `buildSpec()` sends `filesystem`/`network` for container only;
  harness payload unchanged. Edit reload derives custom-chip names from the
  path tail (`/agent-skills/` marker).

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Error |
|---|---|
| bad mount path / dup paths / >2 rows / wrong-service ARN | 422 `validation.invalid_request` (pydantic) |
| BYO mounts with `network: null` | 422 (`AgentSpec` model_validator) |
| attach with unknown/expired staging | 410 `registry.staging_expired` |
| attach selection not staged | per-item `registry.skill_not_staged` |
| bad name override / invalid bundle | per-item `registry.skill_invalid` |
| S3 failure mid-upload | per-item `agents.skill_attach_failed`, partial keys deleted |

### 5. Tests Required

`test_agent_spec_filesystem.py` (validators), `test_runtime_container_fs.py`
(param shapes create+update), `test_container_provision_iam.py` (policy doc +
lifecycle), `test_container_skill_bundle.py` (S3→.claude/skills),
`test_claude_sdk_template.py` (MCP merge/ALLOWED_TOOLS),
`test_agent_skills_attach.py` (staging→S3, no record, cleanup),
`test_agents_api.py::test_create_container_agent_*` (API round-trip).
Browser evidence: `frontend/scripts/sdk_caps_fs_evidence.mjs` →
`design/screenshots/agent-sdk-caps-fs/`.

### 6. Wrong vs Correct

```python
# WRONG: requiring network for every container spec (breaks old agents + session-only)
if spec.method == "container" and spec.network is None: raise ...
# CORRECT: gate on BYO only
if self.filesystem.byo and self.network is None: raise ...

# WRONG: deriving the EFS file-system ARN from the access-point ARN (not encoded there)
resource = efs_ap_arn.split("/access-point/")[0]
# CORRECT: Resource "*" scoped by the ArnEquals AccessPointArn condition

# WRONG: copying the devguide's single combined s3files statement (live-hit 2026-07-13):
{"Action": ["s3files:ClientMount","s3files:ClientWrite","s3files:GetAccessPoint"],
 "Resource": fs_arn, "Condition": {"ArnEquals": {"s3files:AccessPointArn": ap_arns}}}
# GetAccessPoint never matches (wrong resource type + unsupported condition key)
# → UpdateAgentRuntime: "Ensure the role has s3files:GetAccessPoint";
# and even the fixed shape then hits "…ListMountTargets".
# CORRECT: three statements — see _fs_policy_document in §2.

# WRONG: calling Create/UpdateAgentRuntime immediately after put_role_policy changed
# the policy content — IAM propagation window → "missing required permissions".
# CORRECT: wrap the call in _retry_iam_propagation (targeted retry, 10s steps).

# WRONG (ops): seeding bucket objects under an AP's rootDirectory prefix BEFORE the
# first mount — the sync creates the directory root-owned and creationPermissions
# never applies → agent (uid 1001) gets Permission denied on write.
# CORRECT: point the AP at a not-yet-existing prefix; seed the bucket afterwards.

# WRONG (frontend): attaching monorepo picks one-per-request
for i of picked: api.attachSkillSources(sid, [{index: i}])   # 1st success drops staging → 410
# CORRECT: one batched call
api.attachSkillSources(sid, picked.map(index => ({index})))
```
