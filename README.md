# AgentCore Launchpad

A production-grade **enterprise agent platform** built on Amazon Bedrock
AgentCore. It is a customer-deliverable sample asset — not a throwaway demo —
that wires the core AgentCore components to real APIs and real resources in
your own AWS account, and gives users a single place to **create an agent,
deploy it to AgentCore Runtime, and consume it** over chat or HTTP.

## What it is

Launchpad is one console (React) over one FastAPI backend, plus shared AWS
infrastructure (CDK) and a vendored Strands Studio sub-app. It delivers:

- **Three creation methods, one deploy pipeline.** Users create agents via
  **方式A — Claude Agent SDK** (packaged into an ARM64 container image),
  **方式B — Managed Harness** (declarative `CreateHarness` — model, prompt,
  tools, skills, memory; no code, no build), or **方式C — Strands Studio**
  (visual drag-and-drop canvas that generates Strands code). All three
  converge into the same five-stage pipeline and land on AgentCore Runtime
  (方式A/C) or the managed Harness service (方式B).
- **Registry console.** A visual front end over AgentCore Registry for
  cataloguing and discovering the three asset types — agents (A2A), MCP tools,
  and skills — with submit → approve lifecycle actions.
- **Chat playground + public `/v1` API.** Pick any active agent and talk to it
  with streaming responses, multi-turn history, and session-scoped memory. The
  same invoke chain is exposed as an `X-Api-Key`-authenticated `/v1` surface
  for system integration, so both entrances behave identically.
- **Governance.** Cedar policies enforced at the AgentCore Gateway (Allow/Deny
  with the deciding policy id), a decision log, and end-to-end traces read from
  CloudWatch Transaction Search (`aws/spans`).
- **Evaluation & optimization.** Real batch and online evaluation with 13
  built-in evaluators plus custom LLM-as-a-judge, failure-analysis insights,
  and an optimization loop that produces control/treatment **configuration
  bundles**, runs A/B and canary traffic through the gateway, and promotes the
  winner.

For how these map onto AgentCore services, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quickstart (~10 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with Bedrock AgentCore previews enabled (Runtime, Harness,
  Registry, Gateway, Policy, Evaluation) in `us-west-2`
- Credentials with administrator-level access (`aws sts get-caller-identity` works)
- `uv` ≥ 0.8, Node.js ≥ 20 (`npm`), AWS CDK CLI v2 (`npm i -g aws-cdk`),
  Docker (ARM64-capable — only needed for the 方式A container path)
- One-time CDK bootstrap per account/region: `cdk bootstrap aws://<account>/us-west-2`

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend  && uv sync && cd ..
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
cd infra    && uv sync && cd ..
```

### 2. Bootstrap shared infra + AgentCore singletons

```bash
make bootstrap          # = cd backend && uv run python ../scripts/bootstrap.py
```

This deploys the CDK stack `launchpad-base` (only when missing), ensures the
AgentCore registry, memory, gateway and policy engine once, and writes
`config/launchpad.yaml`. It is **idempotent** — a second run prints `reused`.

### 3. Run locally

```bash
make dev    # backend :8000 + frontend :5173 (auto-shifts to :5174 if taken)
```

Open the console at `http://localhost:5173`. Interactive API docs live at
`http://localhost:8000/api/docs`.

### 4. Create your first agent

The fastest path is a **Managed Harness** agent (方式B) — it deploys in about
30 seconds with no build step. Create it from the console's **Create Agent**
page, or with curl:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/agents -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "hr-assistant",
  "method": "harness",
  "system_prompt": "You are a concise HR assistant. Use the hr-database tool for employee questions.",
  "tools": [{"type": "gateway", "name": "hr-database"}],
  "memory": {"short_term": true, "long_term": true}
}'
# → 202 {"agent": {...}, "job_id": "…", "deployment_id": "…"}
```

Poll the deploy job or the agent until it is `active`:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/agents/<AGENT_ID>          # status: deploying → active
curl -s localhost:8000/api/jobs/<JOB_ID>              # per-stage event feed
```

### 5. Chat with it

From the console **Chat** page, or over the public API — first mint a key:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/apikeys -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "quickstart"}'
# → {"id": "…", "prefix": "lp_live_…", "key": "lp_live_<shown-once>"}

curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/v1/agents/<AGENT_ID>/invoke \
  -H "X-Api-Key: lp_live_<full-key>" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "How many vacation days does Maya Chen have left?"}'
# → {"agent":"hr-assistant","text":"…","session_id":"…","latency_ms":…}
```

## Cost notes

Running the demo incurs ordinary AWS usage charges — there is no separate
Launchpad cost. Costs are qualitative and small at demo scale, but scale with
how much you exercise each layer:

- **Runtime / Harness invocations** — every invoke bills model tokens (default
  `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`) plus managed runtime/session compute.
- **Container builds (方式A)** — CodeBuild ARM64 build minutes, roughly 2
  minutes per agent build; 方式B (harness) has no build, and 方式C rides the
  faster zip path.
- **Batch evaluation** — LLM-as-a-judge calls (model tokens) scale with
  evaluators × dataset items; insights runs are heavier and longer.
- **CloudWatch Transaction Search** — trace/span ingestion and storage while
  observability is enabled.
- **Storage** — S3 artifact zips and ECR container images accumulate per agent
  build; AgentCore Memory stores session events and extracted preferences.

**Delete demo agents after use** (console, or `DELETE /api/agents/{id}`), then
run `scripts/teardown.py` to remove the shared infra. See
[docs/teardown.md](docs/teardown.md).
