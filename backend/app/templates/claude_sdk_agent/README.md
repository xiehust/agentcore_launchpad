# Claude Agent SDK container template

ARM64 image for AgentCore Runtime. Pinned versions verified 2026-07-09:

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| python base | `python:3.12-slim` (arm64) |
| node | 22.x (nodesource) |
| `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` CLI | ≥2.1 (2.1.205 verified) |
| `claude-agent-sdk` (python) | ≥0.2,<1 (0.2.114 verified) |
| `bedrock-agentcore` | 1.17.* |
| `aws-opentelemetry-distro` | ≥0.10,<1 |

Bedrock mode: `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` is baked into the image; the claude CLI
uses the runtime execution role for `bedrock:InvokeModel*` — no API key anywhere.

Streaming: the SDK enables partial messages, maps text deltas and tool calls to
AgentCore Runtime SSE events, then emits one final completion event after
tracing and Memory persistence. Updating this template requires republishing an
existing agent; deployed images are immutable. AgentCore also pins an existing
runtime session to the version that first served it, so use a new Chat session
after republishing to verify the new image.

Subagents/skills: drop markdown definitions into `.claude/agents/` (none ship by
default) — registry/custom skills selected in the wizard are bundled into
`.claude/skills/` at build time. `setting_sources=["project"]` makes the SDK
load both from `/app/.claude`.
